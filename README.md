MEAN-AND-VARIANCE-USING-SCILAB

AIM: 
To write a program for mean, variance and cross correlation in SCILAB and verify the output.

EQUIPMENTS Needed

· Computer with i3 Processor · SCI LAB

Algorithm

Define the Function: Specify the function you want to simulate. For example, f(x)=sin⁡(x)f(x) = \sin(x)f(x)=sin(x) or any other function.

Generate Sample Points: Decide on the range and the number of sample points. Generate these sample points within the desired range.

Evaluate the Function: Compute the function values at each of these sample points.

Compute Mean, Variance and Cross Correlation: Use Scilab's functions to calculate the mean and variance of the computed function values.

Display Results: Output the computed mean variance and Cross Correlation

PROCEDURE

· Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment.

· Open SCILAB in System

· Type your code in New Editor

· Save the file

· Execute the code

· If any Error, correct it in code and execute again

· Verify the generated results

PROGRAM

    clear;
    clc;
    clear;
    function X = f(x)
    z=4*(1-x)^2;
    X=x*z;
    endfunction
    a=0;
    b=1;
    EX=intg(a,b,f);
    disp(EX,"i)Mean of X =");
    function X = g(x)
    z=4*(1-x)^2;
    X=x^2*z
    endfunction 
    a=0;
    b=1;
    EX2=intg(a,b,g); 
    disp(EX2,"ii)Variance of X"); 
    x= input("type in the reference sequence="); 
    y= input("type in the second sequence="); 
    n1=max(size(y))-1;
    n2=max(size(x))-1;
    r=corr(x,y,n1);
    plot2d3('gnn',r);

OUTPUT:

<img width="1919" height="1199" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-03 234555" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/211ebcc1-37e5-475b-a4a0-b3ab94e0a1d0" />

Cross Correlation

Type in the reference sequence = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]

Type in the second sequence = [2 4 6 8 10 11 13 15]


RESULT:
Thus the mean , variance and cross correlation are executed in Scilab and output is verified.
